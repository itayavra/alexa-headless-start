## alexa-headless-start
A one-click script to run [alexa-avs-sample-app](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app) headlessly.

As the Alexa sample app has 3 different scripts that are needed to run in a particular order and in particular timings, using it to turn a Raspberry Pi (for example) into a headless/monitorless Alexa device is pretty clumsy.

Unlike other solution I've found online, this script doesn't use sleep commands to time the different alexa-avs-sample-app scripts (so no need to guess how long it might take each script to start), and makes sure the entire process is up as fast as possible (instead of ~6 minutes, just under a minute and a half on my Raspberry Pi Zero W).

In the near future I might add an installer to run Alexa on boot.

## Prerequisites
This script assumes you are running a linux based machine (tested on Raspbian Stretch but should work on others too) and have [alexa-avs-sample-app](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app) already installed and able to run.

## Install
1. Clone the repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/itayavra/alexa-headless-start.git
```

2. Make sure the path to your alexa-avs-sample-app folder is correct inside **alexa-headless-start.js**

3. Run with:
```
cd alexa-headless-start
npm install # Only needed for the first time
npm start
```
4. Enjoy!
